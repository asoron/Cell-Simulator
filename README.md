# Cell-Simulator
Cell Simulator is a Python project powered by Pygame that visualizes the dynamic interactions between cells. Cells attract or repel each other based on their colors and respond to mouse input for added interactivity. It uses a physics-inspired system with customizable parameters for a visually engaging simulation.
